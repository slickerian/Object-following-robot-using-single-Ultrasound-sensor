This is a simple robot created as a mini project for 2nd year in college. Compared to previous versions, this robot uses a single ultrasonic sensor to do a sweep and follow obstacles, without using an array of sensors. This robot uses a simple trick of rotatiing the sensor on a servo, that vastly increases its detection capacity and range. We managed to create this rover from scratch and code it in such a way that it has bluetooth control too.
